      <h2>The History of HTML5</h2>
      <p>HTML, also known as HyperText Markup Language is a programming language that is developed by W3C & WHATWG by using markup HTML5 is the fifth version and also the current major version that is published on October 28, 2014. Since 1998, the development of a new version of HTML had been paused. Until 2004, companies like Apple and Mozilla decided to develop a new version of HTML. Finally, HTML5 is published in 2014. HTML is a web content developer that uses different tags to give the structure of the website. There two types of HTML tags, the first type of tag is called a structural tag which creates a block. The second type is called phrasing tag which is a tag that shows the action that will happen within the block.
      HTML5 improves the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features with some new tags, attributes, and behavior. Some basic elements are !DOCTYPE html, html, head, title, body, etc. These tags tell the action. For example, the !DOCTYPE html tag tells that this document is a HTML5. Goals for HTML5 include allowing web applications to behave more like nature applications in the document and adding more features for the location services. Moreover, it is also designed for all kinds of devices whether it is a laptop or tablet. <br>
