      <h2>The History of HTML5</h2>
      <p>HTML, also known as HyperText Markup Language is a programming language that is developed by W3C & WHATWG by using markup. W3C, also known as World Wide Web Consortium is a big community where a lot of developers work together to maintain a website providing all different of the website over a big organization. HTML5 is published on October 28, 2014. It is the fifth version and also the current major version. Since 1998, the development of the new  HTML had been paused, companies like Apple and Mozilla decided to develop a new version of HTML in 2004. Finally, HTML5 is published in 2014. The reason why it takes so long to publish HTML5 is many people are working together on this development which brings out some conflicts.

        To develop a website, HTML helps to provide the structure for web development and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which takes care of the presentation. Lastly, working with JavaScript, which makes things happen. HTML uses different tags to give the structure of the website. There two types of HTML tags, the first type of tag is called a structural tag which creates a block. The second type is called phrasing tag which is a tag that shows the action that will happen within the block.

        HTML5 improves the language by supporting the latest multimedia and other new features with some new tags, attributes, and behavior. Some basic elements are !DOCTYPE html, html, head, title, body, etc. These tags tell the action. For example, the !DOCTYPE html tag tells that this document is an HTML. It is also designed for all kinds of devices whether it is a laptop or tablet.
