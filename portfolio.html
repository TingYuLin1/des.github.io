        <p>This is a typeface poster. The typeface is Frutiger. This typeface is used mostly for directly signs. Therefore, I added some arrows to emphasize the use of the font.
          For the color, I chose some bright colors such as yello because I want to catch attention just like a sign needs to be eye-catching.</p>

        <p>This poster is created with photoshop. The goal of this poster is to create a poster of a leader in the arts or sciences who is no longer living.
        I chose to do Kate Spade because her style of design was very bright and joyfull. I designed the poster with some elements of her in the background with some bright color scheme to represent her style of color.</p>

      <div class="imagebox3"><img src="project4.png" alt="projects">
        <p>For this poster, I used both Photoshop and Illustrator. Our task for this project is to design an event poster. The poster is designed for a night market with different food and games.
        Therefore, I used some darker colors to emphazise the night atomsphere. </p>
