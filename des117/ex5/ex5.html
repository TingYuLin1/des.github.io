  <h4>Introduction:</h4>
  <p>Zilla Slab is Mozilla's core typeface, used for the Mozilla wordmark,
    headlines and throughout their designs. A contemporary slab serif,
    based on Typotheque's Tesla, it is constructed with smooth curves and
    true italics, which gives text an unexpectedly sophisticated industrial
    look and a friendly approachability in all weights.

    Zilla Slab is a typeface designed by the company called Typotheque. It is a typeface originally designed for a brand named Mozilla for its new identity and the font is used for different website later on. The font is being categorized under open-source typeface that everyone can use it. The most effective example we found that use the font properly is the website of Ohio University. We really like the font because the font gives a really welcome and friendly feeling especially for a website for a education purpose. The font is constructed with smooth curves and true italics, which gives text an unexpectedly sophisticated industrial look and a friendly approachability in all weights. It draws emphasis to give emotion to words. The vibe which the font gives tend to be a more friendly feeling that can suit for diverse reasons not just for website.
