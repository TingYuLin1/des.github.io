      <h3>Story Ending One</h3>
      <p>After my boyfriend came back from the war, I gave him a warm hug. I really missed all the times we had before he went to the war and now that he is back we can now comeback together just like the old days. We haven't seen each other for
        such a long time but we sent letters to share our everyday life. He took out all the letters I sent out to him and we thorugh it again together. We read through the letters and the old memoreris began to comeback in our mind. We got to share
        the stories again, but this time, we were able to tell the story in person and we were able to see the actions and to hear different tones which made me really see what happened during the event. It was already 2 A.M. and I was really tired.
        But as I thought about the time that we had been separated, I was able to stay awake to listen to him talking no matter how tired I was. While he talked for a long time already, finally, the sun rose up and that's the time when we both fell
        into sleep.

        <h3>Story Ending Two</h3>
        <p>After my boyfriend came back from the war, I saw him came in sitting on a wheel chair. He lost both of his legs during the war because he accidentally step on a powerful landmine when he walked back to the camp. I was heartbroken when I
          heard the story of him stepping on the landmine. It was just a few days left to return to home safely but he just happened to step on the landmine accidentally. Although he lost both of his legs. He came back with a big bright smile. He
          told me that we should be happy that at least he is still alive, unlike a lot of his friends who died during the war.
